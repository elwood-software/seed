## Behind-the-scenes

The character is named after American economist [Andrew
Bernard](Andrew_Bernard "wikilink"), professor of international
economics at the [Tuck School of
Business](Tuck_School_of_Business "wikilink") at [Dartmouth
College](Dartmouth_College "wikilink").[^20] While Andy was initially
meant as a temporary character in season 3 of *The Office*, the
character "grew" on [Greg Daniels](Greg_Daniels "wikilink") and the
writers, and they decided to have Andy return to the office from anger
management and become a permanent character.[^21]

## Reception

Initially considered an abrasive addition to the show, Andy Bernard
later became a fan favorite due to his character development throughout
the series.[^22] Fans reportedly did not enjoy Andy's arc in the final
season, which saw him revert to his worst tendencies showed in earlier
seasons and treat his co-workers poorly, with some commentators
wondering if the show's writers did not know what to do with the
character.[^23]

Andy was named one of the most annoying TV characters of 2011 by
*[Vulture](Vulture_(website) "wikilink").*[^24]
*[Nerve](Nerve_(website) "wikilink")* ranked him the second funniest
character in the series, behind only [Michael
Scott](Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "wikilink").[^25] During the [final
season](The_Office_(American_season_9) "wikilink"), Alan Sepinwall of
*[Uproxx](Uproxx "wikilink")* described Andy's personality as a
"malevolent version of Michael Scott",[^26] while Erik Adams of *[The
A.V. Club](The_A.V._Club "wikilink")* wrote, "no amount of last-minute
humanizing can win the audience back to \[Andy's\] side".[^27]
