Michael Gary Scott is a fictional character in the NBC sitcom The Office, portrayed by Steve Carell. Michael is the regional manager of the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of Dunder Mifflin, a paper company, for the majority of the series. Like his counterpart in the original British version of the show, David Brent, he is characterized as a largely incompetent, unproductive, unprofessional boss, though he is depicted as kinder and occasionally shown to be effective at his job in key moments.

Towards the end of the seventh season, he marries human resources representative Holly Flax and moves to Colorado with her in "Goodbye, Michael", an extended episode. He is then absent from the series until the finale.

Carell received significant critical acclaim for his performance. He was nominated six consecutive times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor â€“ Television Series (Musical or Comedy) in 2006.
