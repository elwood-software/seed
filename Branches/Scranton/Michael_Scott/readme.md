# Michael Gary Scott

![Party](party.gif "PARTY")

**Michael Gary Scott** is a fictional character in the
[NBC](NBC "wikilink") sitcom *[The
Office](The_Office_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")*, portrayed by
[Steve Carell](Steve_Carell "wikilink"). Michael is the regional manager
of the [Scranton, Pennsylvania](Scranton,_Pennsylvania "wikilink")
branch of [Dunder Mifflin](Dunder_Mifflin "wikilink"), a paper company,
for the majority of the series. Like his counterpart in the [original
British version of the show](The_Office_(British_TV_series) "wikilink"),
[David Brent](David_Brent "wikilink"), he is characterized as a largely
incompetent, unproductive, unprofessional boss, though he is depicted as
kinder and occasionally shown to be effective at his job in key moments.

Towards the end of the seventh season, he marries human resources
representative [Holly Flax](Holly_Flax "wikilink") and moves to
[Colorado](Colorado "wikilink") with her in "[Goodbye,
Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")", an extended episode. He is then
absent from the series until the finale.

Carell received significant critical acclaim for his performance. He was
nominated six consecutive times for the [Primetime Emmy Award for
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy
Series](Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Lead_Actor_in_a_Comedy_Series "wikilink"),
and won a [Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series
(Musical or
Comedy)](Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actor_–_Television_Series_Musical_or_Comedy "wikilink")
in 2006.[^1]

## Casting

Carell](Steve_Carell "wikilink") portraying Michael Scott in the U.S.
rendition of *[The
Office](The_Office_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")*</span> All original
series characters were adapted for the U.S. version. NBC programmer
Tracy McLaughlin suggested [Paul Giamatti](Paul_Giamatti "wikilink") to
producer [Ben Silverman](Ben_Silverman "wikilink") for the role of
Michael Scott, but the actor declined. [Martin
Short](Martin_Short "wikilink"), [Hank Azaria](Hank_Azaria "wikilink"),
and [Bob Odenkirk](Bob_Odenkirk "wikilink") were also reported to be
interested, with Odenkirk auditioning.[^2] In January 2004,
*[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "wikilink")* reported that Steve Carell of
the popular [Comedy Central](Comedy_Central "wikilink") program *[The
Daily Show with Jon
Stewart](The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart "wikilink")* was in talks for
the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC
mid-season replacement comedy, *[Come to
Papa](Come_to_Papa_(TV_series) "wikilink")*.[^3]

With Carell unavailable, Odenkirk was selected as Michael Scott and was
part of the cast presented to NBC executives.[^4] [Paul
Rudd](Paul_Rudd "wikilink") advised Carell that the American version of
*The Office* would never be as good as the British version.[^5] However,
*Come to Papa* was quickly cancelled, allowing Carell to commit to *The
Office*. Odenkirk went on to appear in the series in a brief role as an
office manager reminiscent of Scott. Carell later said that he had seen
only about half of the original pilot episode of the British series
before he auditioned, and that he did not continue watching for fear
that he would start copying [Ricky Gervais](Ricky_Gervais "wikilink")'s
characterizations. On the audio commentary of [the pilot
episode](Pilot_(The_Office) "wikilink"), director [Ken
Kwapis](Ken_Kwapis "wikilink") says that Carell's unfamiliarity with the
British version of *The Office* and their experience working together on
*[Watching Ellie](Watching_Ellie "wikilink")* influenced his being cast
as Scott.[^6]

[Stanley Tucci](Stanley_Tucci "wikilink"), [Philip Seymour
Hoffman](Philip_Seymour_Hoffman "wikilink"), [Bruno
Kirby](Bruno_Kirby "wikilink"), [Tim Blake
Nelson](Tim_Blake_Nelson "wikilink"), [Stephen
Colbert](Stephen_Colbert "wikilink"), [David
Herman](David_Herman "wikilink"), [Mike
White](Mike_White_(filmmaker) "wikilink"), [Greg
Kinnear](Greg_Kinnear "wikilink"), [David
Cross](David_Cross "wikilink"), [Rob
Schneider](Rob_Schneider "wikilink"), and [Noah
Emmerich](Noah_Emmerich "wikilink"), among others, turned down the
role.[^7]

[Rick Moranis](Rick_Moranis "wikilink"), [Dan
Aykroyd](Dan_Aykroyd "wikilink"), [Eugene Levy](Eugene_Levy "wikilink"),
[Dan Castellaneta](Dan_Castellaneta "wikilink"), [David
Koechner](David_Koechner "wikilink") (who went on to play supporting
character [Todd Packer](Todd_Packer "wikilink")), [David
Arquette](David_Arquette "wikilink"), [Richard
Kind](Richard_Kind "wikilink"), [Robert
Townsend](Robert_Townsend_(actor) "wikilink"), [Steve

Favreau](Jon_Favreau "wikilink"), [William H.
Macy](William_H._Macy "wikilink"), and [John C.
Reilly](John_C._Reilly "wikilink") were also considered for the
role.[^8][^9] [Louis C.K.](Louis_C.K. "wikilink") also read for the
role, but he was not able to get it as he had a deal with
[CBS](CBS "wikilink").[^10]

Two of Carell's supporting film roles helped get audiences' attention:
in *[Bruce Almighty](Bruce_Almighty "wikilink")*, where Carell plays
Evan Baxter, who gets a humorous comeuppance while co-anchoring the
news; and in *[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron
Burgundy](Anchorman:_The_Legend_of_Ron_Burgundy "wikilink")*, where
Carell played slow-witted weatherman Brick Tamland. Although *The
Office* premiered to mediocre ratings, [NBC](NBC "wikilink") renewed it
for another season because of the anticipated success of Carell's movie
*[The 40-Year-Old Virgin](The_40-Year-Old_Virgin "wikilink")*,[^11] and
the series subsequently became a ratings success. Carell won a [Golden
Globe](Golden_Globe "wikilink") and [Television Critics
Association](Television_Critics_Association "wikilink") award in 2006
for his role, and received [Emmy](Emmy "wikilink") nominations from 2006
to 2011.

Although *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* was a surprise success, Carell said in
an interview with *[Entertainment
Weekly](Entertainment_Weekly "wikilink")* that he had no plans to leave
*The Office*. However, on the [BBC Radio 5
Live](BBC_Radio_5_Live "wikilink") Film Review show, he said that his
time on the show would probably end when his contract ran out after
Season 7.[^12] This was later confirmed on June 28, 2010, when he
announced that the seventh season would be his last.[^13]

## Character details, arc, backstory

### Biography

Michael Gary Scott was born on March 15, 1965,[^14][^15] in Scranton,
Pennsylvania. He came from a relatively difficult childhood of
loneliness. In the pilot, he mentions having a brother. Michael had some
trouble with his early education (shown in "[Dunder Mifflin
Infinity](Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity "wikilink")") as Michael tells the
camera crew he was held back in second grade. In "[Diversity
Day](Diversity_Day_(The_Office) "wikilink")", be claims to be of
English, Irish, German and Scottish descent, and also claims to be
"two-fifteenths" Native American. He has mentioned a stepfather, Jeff,
whom he despises. In "[Nepotism](Nepotism_(The_Office) "wikilink")", it
is revealed that he had a half-sister, from whom he'd been estranged for
15 years. After their reunion, Michael hires her son (and his nephew)
Luke as an office intern, but eventually confronts the incompetent, rude
young man and spanks him in front of the office staff, causing him to
burst into tears and quit.

In the episode "[Take Your Daughter to Work
Day](Take_Your_Daughter_to_Work_Day_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael
claims that he was a child star on a kids' show called *Fundle Bundle*;
however, it becomes clear that he simply appeared on the show as one of
many guest children. As the office staff watch an old recording of his
episode, the young Michael speaks touchingly about what he wants when he
grows up: to get married, and to have "100 kids" so none of them could
say no to being his friend. Michael did not attend college, having lost
all his tuition money in a [pyramid scheme](pyramid_scheme "wikilink").

Michael started at Dunder Mifflin as a salesman in the early 1990s. In
"[Dwight's Speech](Dwight's_Speech "wikilink")", he shows the plaque and
certificates he received in 1996 and 1997 for 'Top Salesman of the
Year'. Dwight also praised him in a deleted scene from "[The
Coup](The_Coup_(The_Office) "wikilink")" for winning consecutive awards
for the best salesman. In "[Two
Weeks](Two_Weeks_(The_Office) "wikilink")", he claims to have acquired
half of the Scranton branch's client base. In "[The
Client](The_Client_(The_Office) "wikilink")", he impresses his
then-manager, [Jan Levinson-Gould](Jan_Levinson-Gould "wikilink"), by
single-handedly acquiring an important client through somewhat
unorthodox methods. [Pam Halpert](Pam_Beesly "wikilink") and [Ryan
Howard](Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "wikilink") are impressed watching him
make sales and negotiate their contracts for The Michael Scott Paper
Company, which he starts when he leaves Dunder Mifflin. In "[Koi
Pond](Koi_Pond_(The_Office) "wikilink")", [Jim
Halpert](Jim_Halpert "wikilink") concedes that he might never become as
good a salesman as Michael.

During a candid conversation in "[The
Fire](The_Fire_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael tells Ryan that he
became a salesman because he loved making friends. After being promoted
to regional manager at a young age, he continued to treat work-related
relationships as personal friendships, which he acknowledged was
complicated because his colleagues were lower than him in the
workplace's hierarchy. He seems to have few relationships outside the
office.

In his interactions with other characters, Michael is oblivious to most
social norms. He tends to overestimate his own importance in the eyes of
his coworkers, and can't understand why they don't share his enthusiasm
for his unconventional ideas and interests. He believes an office should
be the "place where dreams come true."

He is loyal to the company and tries to help his employees when he
thinks they are having problems. Michael has been at Dunder Mifflin (as
of "[Michael's Last Dundies](Michael's_Last_Dundies "wikilink")")
9,986,000 minutes, which means that he has worked there since April
1992.

Michael's constant desire to be the center of attention often manifests
itself in selfish behavior. When he burns his foot in "[The
Injury](The_Injury "wikilink")", he expects Pam and Ryan to tend to his
needs, despite Dwight's much more serious concussion. When invited to
"[Phyllis' Wedding](Phyllis'_Wedding "wikilink")", he assumes his
participation will be the high point of the ceremony. He pouts when he
is upstaged by Phyllis' elderly father, eventually giving an insulting,
overly familiar toast that gets him banned from the reception. His
desire to be liked often leads him to make unwise decisions and
unfeasible promises without considering the consequences, only to back
out when they result in an undesirable comeuppance. He appears to
emphasize moments of sympathy or civility directed at him by his
coworkers (mostly Jim) and inflates their importance to compensate for
his loneliness.

Michael is irresponsible with his finances, and at one point is so
heavily in debt he must take a second job as a
[telemarketer](telemarketing "wikilink"). Oscar, an office accountant,
makes a chart of Michael's spending habits and chides him for spending
too much money on things "nobody ever needs", such as multiple [magic
sets](magic_sets "wikilink") and professional [bass
fishing](bass_fishing "wikilink") equipment. Eventually, Michael is
forced to [declare bankruptcy](bankruptcy "wikilink") (which he thinks
requires only standing up and shouting "I declare bankruptcy!").

Due to his lack of common sense, Michael is often the butt of jokes. He
is quick to take offense when wronged and his response is often
disproportionate to the harm he suffers. Similarly, when he
unintentionally offends people, he is remorseful and apologizes; the
most notable example is in "[Gay Witch
Hunt](Gay_Witch_Hunt "wikilink")", when he cries after realizing his use
of the term "faggy" hurt Oscar's feelings. Even though he is often
oblivious to criticism, derision and sarcasm, there are limits to his
patience—for example, when he demands professional respect from [Stanley
Hudson](Stanley_Hudson "wikilink") in "[Did I
Stutter?](Did_I_Stutter? "wikilink")", and defends Holly against the
staff's criticism in "[Business
Ethics](Business_Ethics_(The_Office) "wikilink")".

In "[The Meeting](The_Meeting_(The_Office) "wikilink")", it is shown
that Michael does not always consider his employees' success, or even
his own, when he sabotages Jim with a bad recommendation, mistakenly
believing Jim's promotion would lead to Michael's firing. He does,
however, concede to a co-managerial position with Jim to avoid losing
him.

A hopeless romantic, Michael has had several romantic relationships,
most notably with executive Jan, who becomes so domineering over that he
ends their relationship. He eventually settles down with Holly, who
shares his sense of humor and "gets him". He eventually quits Dunder
Mifflin and moves to Boulder, Colorado to help Holly care for her ailing
parents. In unseen events, they marry and have four children.

### Interests

original-image-src="Michael_Scotts_desk_(3817584647).jpg"
original-image-title="Michael's desk on the set of the show in 2009">Michael's
desk on the set of the show in 2009</span> Michael's catchphrase is
"[That's what *she* said!](That's_what_she_said "wikilink")", which he
utters—even in places such as business meetings and legal
depositions—whenever someone says something that can be made into a
sexually suggestive [double entendre](double_entendre "wikilink"). He
finds the phrase so irresistible that in "[Sexual
Harassment](Sexual_Harassment_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Jim induces him
to say it just seconds after [Jan Levinson](Jan_Levinson "wikilink") and
a corporate lawyer specifically ask him to stop.

Michael has diverse interests in media. Song parody writing is often
referred to: In "[Goodbye, Toby](Goodbye,_Toby "wikilink")", he relates
the titles of two of his songs, "Beers in Heaven" (a "[Tears In
Heaven](Tears_In_Heaven "wikilink")" parody) and "Total Eclipse of the
Fart" (a "[Total Eclipse of the
Heart](Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart "wikilink")" parody), before singing a
rendition of "[Goodbye Stranger](Goodbye_Stranger "wikilink")" as a
departing gesture to Toby. He performs his parody of "[The Chanukah
Song](The_Chanukah_Song "wikilink")" to reflect the
[Diwali](Diwali_(The_Office) "wikilink") celebration Kelly hosts.

In "[Dream Team](Dream_Team_(The_Office) "wikilink")", he comes up with
"Achey Breaky Fart (an "[Achy Breaky
Heart](Achy_Breaky_Heart "wikilink")" parody) and "My Stumps" (a "[My
Humps](My_Humps "wikilink")" parody) during a brainstorming exercise. He
aspires to finish filming his original movie, "Threat Level: Midnight",
whose script the staff finds and gives a [table
reading](Read-through "wikilink"). After ten years of production, often
using areas of the office as sets, Michael screens the completed movie
for the staff in the seventh-season episode of the same name.

Michael loves the theatrical stylings of [Meryl
Streep](Meryl_Streep "wikilink"), describing her in "[The
Job](The_Job_(The_Office) "wikilink")" as the "best actor around," and
mimics her character from *[The Devil Wears
Prada](The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film) "wikilink")* after seeing the film.
He loves [Wikipedia](Wikipedia "wikilink") and
[YouTube](YouTube "wikilink"), although he does not seem to understand
how they work and thinks they are news media organizations. He also
likes the music of [Billy Joel](Billy_Joel "wikilink") and
[U2](U2 "wikilink"); the movies *[Mean Girls](Mean_Girls "wikilink")*,
*[Million Dollar Baby](Million_Dollar_Baby "wikilink")*, *[Die
Hard](Die_Hard "wikilink")*, [*What a Girl
Wants*](What_a_Girl_Wants_(film) "wikilink"); and television series such
as *[ALF](ALF_(TV_series) "wikilink")*,
*[Entourage](Entourage_(U.S._TV_series) "wikilink")*, *[The L
Word](The_L_Word "wikilink")* and *[Queer as
Folk](Queer_as_Folk_(U.S._TV_series) "wikilink")*. He tends to be a bit
"behind" when it comes to popular culture references, as when he refers
to his then-girlfriend Jan's youthful male assistant as [James Van Der
Beek](James_Van_Der_Beek "wikilink"), or in his numerous ringtones,
including "My Humps" and "Mambo Number Five".

He appears to have a history of playing [ice
hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink") and demonstrates his skating talent in
"[Michael's Birthday](Michael's_Birthday "wikilink")". He says that in
high school, after his math teacher told him he was going to flunk out,
he went out the next day and "scored more goals than anyone in the
history of the hockey team." He also invites potential clients to
[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton
Penguins](Wilkes-Barre/Scranton_Penguins "wikilink") games. He expresses
interest in [basketball](basketball "wikilink"), even though he is
terrible at it (seem in "[The Fire](The_Fire_(The_Office) "wikilink")",
"[Basketball](Basketball_(The_Office) "wikilink")" and "[Goodbye,
Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")"). He is a [Pittsburgh
Pirates](Pittsburgh_Pirates "wikilink") fan, and does not like the [New
York Mets](New_York_Mets "wikilink").

His other interests include a pair of Levi's he refers to as "fun
jeans", which he has professionally dry cleaned and the reason he
started casual Fridays; his self-bought "World's Best Boss" mug from
[Spencer Gifts](Spencer_Gifts "wikilink"); and
[Chrysler](Chrysler "wikilink") automobiles. He drives a silver 2004
[Sebring convertible](Chrysler_Sebring "wikilink") for the first three
seasons until he trades it in with Jan's Volvo for a shared [Porsche
Boxster](Porsche_Boxster "wikilink") in the episode
"[Money](Money_(The_Office) "wikilink")". After their relationship, he
drives a red [PT Cruiser convertible](Chrysler_PT_Cruiser "wikilink")
and later a newer-model Sebring as a benefit of the buyout of the
Michael Scott Paper Company to Dunder Mifflin in
"[Broke](Broke_(The_Office) "wikilink")". He enjoys planning fantasy
entrepreneurial schemes, such as a men's shoe store called "Shoe La La",
and another paper company called simply "Michael".

### Personality and management style

Apart from his masterful salesmanship, Michael is lacking in almost any
other skills, management or otherwise. [Jim
Halpert](Jim_Halpert "wikilink") once made a color graph of how Michael
spends his time: 80% distracting others; 19% procrastination; and 1%
critical thinking. Jim added that he inflated the "critical thinking"
percentage so people could actually see it on the graph. His laid-back
approach more often results in lower than expected workplace
productivity, particularly when Michael places personal interests as a
priority over work (such as his birthday, someone else's birthday, or
his various seminars). To avoid being disciplined for his foolish
actions, Michael often resorts to
[scapegoating](scapegoating "wikilink") employees to cover himself.
Although his actions often lead to more problems for his employees,
Michael believes that Scranton is "the cool, fun branch... like *[Animal
House](Animal_House "wikilink")*". He is genuinely upset when the top
salesman from the Utica office criticizes the Scranton in a phone call
and declares it "worse than [Camden](Camden,_New_Jersey "wikilink")".

Although his position as regional manager gives him broad
decision-making authority on branch operations, he often places those
responsibilities secondary to his desire to be friends with his
employees. On the other hand, he also oversteps his authority by hosting
events that corporate disapproves of, such as [The
Dundies](The_Dundies "wikilink") and several office parties a year,
inducing birthday parties for each employee despite only being allowed
the budget for one a year.

It is revealed in the episode "[The
Duel](The_Duel_(The_Office) "wikilink")" the Scranton branch is the
best-performing company branch, well ahead of
[Utica](Utica,_New_York "wikilink") and
[Nashua](Nashua,_New_Hampshire "wikilink"). Michael is called to
corporate headquarters to answer the question, "What are you doing
right?" After several minutes of Michael's inarticulate babble, his
superiors concede that while Michael is definitely doing something
right, they will probably never know exactly what. They send him on a
lecture tour to spread his wisdom; instead, he wastes time and annoys
the workers who have to listen to his drivel.

Despite his ineptitude, Michael is prone to brief bouts of surprising
insight and is shown to have a kind heart as he shows deep, family-like
affection towards the people working in the Scranton branch. The staff
initially finds Michael annoying but he grows on many of them and is
given many emotional goodbyes during his final days in Scranton. In the
episode "[Broke](Broke_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael displays
self-awareness of his inability to keep secrets when he, Pam and Ryan
all agree not to let Dunder Mifflin know the Michael Scott Paper Company
is broke. Moments later he is seen bent over and in a panic when he
admits that he's afraid he won't be able to keep himself from letting
the truth slip. In the same episode, he displays a remarkable ability to
negotiate with Dunder Mifflin and convince the company to hire himself
as well as Pam and Ryan back with full benefits.

In the episode "[Murder](Murder_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Jim attempts
to confront Michael for wasting time when he has the staff participate
in a murder-mystery role playing game. However, he is confronted by an
unusually serious and stern Michael, who demands to, "just let them
\[the staff\] have this game". Jim then realized Michael actually was
trying to distract the staff from the possibility of losing their jobs
after a news article hinted at Dunder Mifflin going bankrupt.

In the episode "[Business
School](Business_School_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael is one of the
few Dunder Mifflin employees to show up to Pam's gallery showing. Unlike
Oscar and his then-boyfriend Gil, who had shown up and were critical of
Pam's drawings (which Pam overheard), Michael immediately marvels at her
work and asks to buy Pam's drawing of their office building. In a moment
of sincere kindness, Michael tells Pam that he is very proud of her. Pam
begins to tear up and hugs him. During "[The
Seminar](The_Seminar_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael advises a
fledgling [Andy Bernard](Andy_Bernard "wikilink") to step up and begin
selling at a seminar Andy is hosting, in order to boost his sagging
sales.

Michael's habits of joking around and treating professional colleagues
as personal friends are often inappropriate for management. However,
along with his encyclopedic knowledge of the paper industry, it is
remarkably effective when utilized to sign clients, as seen in "[The
Client](The_Client_(The_Office) "wikilink")" and "[Heavy
Competition](Heavy_Competition "wikilink")." In
"[Initiation](Initiation_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Pam balks at
Michael's sugar-fueled phone calls to a local business, but later
realizes that his silly conversation (including a [Bill
Cosby](Bill_Cosby "wikilink") imitation) helped to secure a major sale
for Dunder Mifflin. He remembers people through word association
starting with nicknames such as "baldy" and "fatso" which, while
offensive to the individuals in question, works to his advantage.
Although he is unsuccessful using his sales methods as a telemarketer in
"[Money](Money_(The_Office) "wikilink")", his social interactions with
coworkers suggest that he would be a more popular presence in an office
of peers as opposed to subordinates.

It is clear Michael loves Dunder Mifflin very much. He has also shown
signs of feeling underappreciated, given his long history with the
company. In the episode "[The Negotiation](The_Negotiation "wikilink")",
Michael discovers that he is making only slightly more money than
Darryl, the warehouse manager, despite working for the company for 14
years. Later in the episode he drives to New York and demands a raise
from Jan at corporate headquarters.

In the episode "[New Boss](New_Boss "wikilink")", Dunder Mifflin CFO
David Wallace ducks Michael's calls throughout the day. When Michael's
15-year anniversary party is cancelled by his new superior, Charles
Miner, he drives to New York to confront Wallace. Citing his long
history of service and many sacrifices, Michael asks that he be treated
more respectfully. Wallace, seeing his heartfelt openness, promises
Michael his party and pledges to attend. Michael surprisingly recognizes
that the CFO is just humoring him, and stuns Wallace by quitting his
job.

## Relationships

Michael tends to overestimate his importance to his employees, but
despite constantly offending some of them, he has a close bond with
them. Most of the employees have been the focus of Michael's jokes at
one point or another, usually in reference to their race, sex, size,
attractiveness, or sexual orientation. Examples of Michael's difficult
relationship with his staff include getting slapped by Kelly for being
racist, hitting Meredith with his car, getting kicked out of Phyllis and
Bob's wedding, and [outing](outing "wikilink") Oscar to the entire
office without his permission. They are, however, generally sympathetic
to his shortcomings and, while regularly losing patience when he
interrupts their workflow, often try to assist him with his personal
problems.

Michael's relationship with the company warehouse employees is tense. He
has a tendency to disrupt their daily work flow, and in a talking head
interview, warehouse supervisor [Darryl
Philbin](Darryl_Philbin "wikilink") ([Craig
Robinson](Craig_Robinson_(actor) "wikilink")) explains that they have
never been able to make a full year accident-free because of Michael's
antics. [CFO](CFO "wikilink") [David
Wallace](David_Wallace_(The_Office) "wikilink") tolerates Michael's
antics because he values his loyalty to the company, but Michael offends
[CEO](CEO "wikilink") Alan Brand and the rest of the executives during
his only meeting with them.

Although many Dunder Mifflin employees are initially barely able to
tolerate Michael, they gradually grow to appreciate his sincere
intentions, even at times coming to find amusement in his sophomoric
humor and behavior; this transition is most apparent in [Pam
Halpert](Pam_Beesly "wikilink"), with whom he eventually develops a
genuine friendship. His co-workers are overjoyed when Michael finds his
soulmate in [Holly Flax](Holly_Flax "wikilink"); they participate in his
romantic proposal to her and are shown to be emotional at his leaving
Scranton to be with her. Jim Halpert even teared up while calling
Michael "the best boss \[he\] ever had."

### Dwight Schrute

[Dwight](Dwight_Schrute "wikilink") has the most respect for Michael,
viewing him as a model for success, and is thrilled when asked to handle
any task given to him, however ill-conceived it may be. Although on the
surface, Michael usually appears dismissive of Dwight and generally
views him as a suck-up, he is genuinely hurt and angry at the few times
when Dwight has deceived him, such as when Dwight went over Michael's
head to vie for the manager's job or when Dwight refused to reveal
office secrets to Michael's new company, the "Michael Scott Paper
Company". In the episode "[Heavy
Competition](Heavy_Competition "wikilink")" of Season 5, Dwight takes
Michael's [Rolodex](Rolodex "wikilink") and finds his own business card,
on the back of which, Michael had written (before leaving Dunder
Mifflin): "Dwight Schrute, tall, beets".

Michael also cares how Dwight feels about him. After Michael beats
Dwight at his own dojo, Michael finds out that Dwight no longer wanted
Michael as his primary contact in case of an emergency which causes
Michael to promote him from "Assistant to the Regional Manager" to
"Assistant Regional Manager", with a three-month probational period.
Dwight told Michael in Season 6 that Michael's pathetic career path hurt
Dwight and he regretted working for him instead of taking a fast-track
job at [Home Depot](Home_Depot "wikilink"), but they buried their
differences later on. When Deangelo Vickers arrives to be the new Branch
Manager, Dwight is depressed that he didn't get the job after Michael
recommended him, only to learn from Gabe that Michael didn't recommend
him after all. At first Dwight is angry with Michael, but they make
amends when Michael gives him a letter of recommendation on his final
day at [Dunder Mifflin](Dunder_Mifflin "wikilink"). They end the day
with a paintball fight behind the building. In the [series
finale](Finale_(The_Office) "wikilink"), Michael is the best man at
Dwight's wedding after Jim arranges it.

### Ryan Howard

Michael has one-sided affection for
[Ryan](Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "wikilink"), which often makes Ryan
uncomfortable. Examples of this are when Michael gives Ryan the "Hottest
in the Office" award in [The Dundies](The_Dundies "wikilink"), when
Michael declares he would definitely want to have sex with Ryan in [The
Fire](The_Fire_(The_Office) "wikilink"), and when Michael gives Ryan a
\$400 [iPod](iPod "wikilink") for the Secret Santa gift exchange,
despite the 20-dollar limit. In "[The
Deposition](The_Deposition_(The_Office) "wikilink")", a page from
Michael's diary reveals he describes Ryan as "just as hot as Jan, but in
a different way." On multiple occasions, Michael behaves inappropriately
around Ryan, including slapping Ryan's buttocks, pinching Ryan's
nipples, staring constantly at Ryan from behind his window blind,
pinning Ryan to sit on his lap and making kissing gestures toward Ryan
while calling him *the belle of the ball*.

Michael is devastated when he finds out about Ryan's arrest for fraud,
and much to the dismay of David Wallace, he later re-hires Ryan. In
"[Prince Family Paper](Prince_Family_Paper "wikilink")", Michael
acknowledges that his heart has led him astray before, naming Jan and
Ryan as examples of this. In "[Dream
Team](Dream_Team_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael convinces Ryan to
leave his job at the bowling alley and join his newly formed paper
company. When working together, Ryan comes to respect Michael's skills
as a salesman. In Season 7, Michael heavily invests in Ryan's WUPHF.com
and won't agree to sell his majority shares when it is clear Ryan is
exploiting Michael's goodwill and is incapable of saving the venture
from bankruptcy.

Michael's obsession with Ryan is further shown in a number of deleted
scenes. In one from "[Diwali](Diwali_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Carol
says that Michael constantly talks about Ryan's attractiveness and has
begun stalking Ryan. In another from "[Safety
Training](Safety_Training_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael confesses
that he will miss Ryan the most after dying, which angers Ryan. In a
deleted scene of "[Beach Games](Beach_Games "wikilink")", Michael says
he especially wants to see Ryan put a hot dog in his mouth. In "[Night
Out](Night_Out_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael is in bed with Ryan
asking "Do you miss us?," to which Ryan declines to answer.

### Jim and Pam Halpert

Michael doesn't hesitate to compliment or criticize Pam for her looks
and he frequently mentions her breasts. In the episode
"[Diwali](Diwali_(The_Office) "wikilink")" Michael mistakenly thinks
that he and Pam have a connection, and is rejected when he tries to kiss
her. Throughout their relationship, Pam has served as something of a
[shoulder angel](shoulder_angel "wikilink") for Michael by encouraging
him to be more productive and discouraging his bad ideas, with varying
degrees of success. She grows closer to Michael as he supports her goals
in pursuing sales and art. Pam is visibly touched when, after many art
show attendees (including Oscar and his boyfriend Gil) dismiss her
artwork, Michael is so impressed that he asks to buy her painting of
their office building. Their relationship comes to a rocky point when he
begins dating her mother Helene. This is only repaired after he breaks
up with Helene and allows Pam to slap him in the face in the parking
lot. He trusts and respects Jim, although when they were co-managers
they clashed due to their polar-opposite management styles. In "[Secret
Santa](Secret_Santa_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael mentions that in
a future vision he sees himself and his future wife living next door to
Jim and Pam and that their children will play together. He often also
refers to Jim as his best friend in the office, although, based on his
impersonation of Jim using surfer slang in "[Michael's Last
Dundies](Michael's_Last_Dundies "wikilink")", does not have a very good
understanding of his personality.

While Jim and Pam are both shown to care about Michael, his clingy
nature makes them reluctant to socialize with him outside of the office;
such as when, after numerous unsuccessful invitations, Michael is forced
to trick them in order to have them over for a disastrous dinner in the
episode "[Dinner Party](Dinner_Party_(The_Office) "wikilink")." In a
Season 5 episode, Michael also shows his admiration for Jim, when Jim
wears a tuxedo to work and goes on and on about having a 'classy party'
for the party planning committee, and frequently suggests all of the
ideas Dwight had offered that Michael had then rejected, only to bother
Dwight by having Michael accept the same ideas from him. During Cecilia
Halpert's baptism, Michael approaches Pam referring to himself as "the
godfather" while imitating [Don Corleone](Vito_Corleone "wikilink"),
after which she sympathetically but emphatically asks him to acknowledge
that he won't be Cece's godfather, he is disappointed but does so and is
hurt to learn that the godparents are a couple they'd only recently met.
Pam is shown to have a soft spot for Michael, such as when she consoles
him after he finds Holly to be in a relationship with AJ, and when she
advises him on how to propose to Holly. In "[Goodbye,
Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")" it is revealed that Michael is
secretly planning to leave for Colorado at the end of his penultimate
work day, thereby avoiding having to say goodbye to everyone. Jim
figures this out and goes along with it, telling Michael that he will
tell him what a great boss he was the following day at lunch, which they
both know Michael will not be around for; Michael and Jim both get
sentimental during this final conversation between them. The strength of
his relationship with Pam is revealed as he continuously asks about her
whereabouts, not wanting to leave without saying goodbye.

Pam, who spent the better part of the day away from the office, finds
Michael at the airport and says goodbye in a touching scene just as he's
about to board his plane for Colorado. She watches from the window as
his plane flies off. In a deleted scene of "[The Inner
Circle](The_Inner_Circle_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Pam is flattered
that Michael named his new dog "Pamela Beagsley." Pam later teases Jim
that their second child will be named "little Michael Scott" displaying
the friendship she had developed with her former boss. In the [series
finale](Finale_(The_Office) "wikilink"), Jim convinces Michael to
replace him as the "bestest mensch" at Dwight's wedding. Pam is so
thrilled to see photos of Michael's children that she does not judge him
for paying for two phones to hold all the pictures.

### Toby Flenderson

Despite liking the majority of the staff, Michael fiercely hates [Human
Resources Manager](Human_Resources_Manager "wikilink") Toby Flenderson.
The origins of Michael's hatred for Toby go largely unexplained in the
show itself, although writer/executive producer [Paul
Lieberstein](Paul_Lieberstein "wikilink"), who also portrays Flenderson,
has said that the genesis of the joke for the writers was in a deleted
scene where Toby signs Meredith's birthday card.[^16][^17][^18] Within
the context of actual aired scenes, as Human Resources Manager Toby
often has to reprimand Michael for violating company policies, which is
consistently a source of friction between the two.

Michael's long-time goal is to get rid of Toby and any attempts at
reconciliation between the two usually backfire. In the episode
"[Goodbye, Toby](Goodbye,_Toby "wikilink")", Michael is thrilled when
Toby decides to move to [Costa Rica](Costa_Rica "wikilink") and gives as
his going away present a rock with a note that reads "Suck on this". The
next season, after Toby's replacement Holly is transferred, Michael is
horrified when Toby returns to Dunder Mifflin. In "[Frame
Toby](Frame_Toby "wikilink")", he goes to great lengths to get him
fired, trying to frame him for possession of
[marijuana](marijuana "wikilink"). In "[The
Chump](The_Chump "wikilink")", Michael says if he had a gun with two
bullets and was in a room with [Adolf Hitler](Adolf_Hitler "wikilink"),
[Osama bin Laden](Osama_bin_Laden "wikilink"), and Toby, he would shoot
Toby twice. In "[Nepotism](Nepotism_(The_Office) "wikilink")", after
Michael spanks Luke, the office intern who is also his nephew, he is
ordered to attend counseling sessions moderated by Toby, much to
Michael's horror. At first Michael is uncooperative but is gradually
tricked by Toby into discussing therapeutic details of his life and
childhood. In "[Michael's Last
Dundies](Michael's_Last_Dundies "wikilink")", Michael eggs Toby's house
while he and Deangelo are handing out Dundie nominations in the cold
open. In "[Goodbye, Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")", Michael is
seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating
that he will miss Toby on some level in spite of his tremendous
animosity towards him.

### Erin Hannon

Once Pam is promoted to salesperson following Dunder Mifflin's buyout of
The Michael Scott Paper Company, Michael keeps [Erin
Hannon](Erin_Hannon "wikilink") as her replacement. Michael is initially
unkind to her as he misses having Pam as his receptionist, but she is
able to earn his respect by cheering him up after his disastrous school
visit in "[Scott's Tots](Scott's_Tots "wikilink")." Unlike her
predecessor, Erin loves working as a receptionist, admires Michael and
cheerfully accommodates many of his unusual requests (such as serving
him a plate of [ants on a log](ants_on_a_log "wikilink") every day at
2:30 and spinning him in his chair until he's dizzy). Although he
generally enjoys Erin's thoughtful treatment, his dismissive feelings
towards Erin continue until "[Secretary's
Day](Secretary's_Day_(The_Office) "wikilink")" when he reluctantly
agrees to take her out to lunch. Erin relishes the opportunity to spend
time with her boss, while Michael finds their conversation awkward and
mentions that her then-boyfriend [Andy Bernard](Andy_Bernard "wikilink")
was previously engaged to [Angela Martin](Angela_Martin "wikilink").
Erin was previously unaware of this, and after learning of it she ends
her relationship with Andy. Later that day, Michael apologizes to Erin;
the two are finally able to relate to each other over their mutual
fondness for silly humor, stemming from their similar immature
tendencies with Michael's ignorance and Erin's naïveté.

Their working relationship then develops smoothly while they bond by
making each other laugh with childish jokes, such as Erin pointing out
that the phrase "it's not" sounds like "snot." In "[Viewing
Party](Viewing_Party "wikilink")", Erin throws a
*[Glee](Glee_(TV_series) "wikilink")* party with her new boyfriend,
[Gabe Lewis](Gabe_Lewis_(The_Office) "wikilink"). Throughout the night,
she unsuccessfully attempts to get Michael and Gabe to bond. Michael is
jealous that the office looks to Gabe as the boss and attempts to
sabotage the party. After being confronted by Erin in private, Michael
questions why his opinion matters so much to her as he is not her
father. In a moment of insight, Michael realizes that Erin, who was
raised in foster care, does indeed look to him as a father figure and he
instigates a playful fight as father and daughter by saying "go to your
room, young lady!" Erin becomes protective of Michael to the point where
she is hostile towards Holly Flax, saying in a talking head interview
that she doesn't understand what Michael sees in her, until *[The
Search](The_Search_(The_Office) "wikilink")* when she, Dwight and Holly
go searching for a missing Michael.

Erin sees that Holly is able to sense where Michael is, and when she
sees them reconcile, she finally understands their love for each other
and smiles. Later in "[Goodbye, Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")",
Erin talks to Michael about her love life and wishes that she knew her
birth mother so she could tell Erin what to do. Michael advises Erin
that she shouldn't rush things and that she'll know what to do when the
right guy comes along. Michael then tells her that she won't need her
mother for advice, because she will always have his personal phone
number when she needs advice and kisses her on the head.

### Holly Flax

Shortly after the dissolution of his troubled relationship with Jan,
Michael found love with [Holly Flax](Holly_Flax "wikilink") ([Amy
Ryan](Amy_Ryan "wikilink")), Toby's replacement as HR Representative,
who appears for a while to be Michael's best chance at love, with the
two sharing a similar sense of humor and social awkwardness. However,
after David Wallace witnesses them kissing, Holly is transferred to the
[Nashua](Nashua,_New_Hampshire "wikilink") branch and she and Michael
break up after choosing not to pursue a long-distance relationship.
Despite the breakup and Holly's new relationship with another man, their
affection for each other persists, as it is shown that Holly had been
writing a note for Michael on her work computer, as well as their subtle
romantic glances at one another during the summer company picnic.
Throughout her absence in Season 5, excluding "Company Picnic" and
carrying on into Season 7, Michael hooks up with a few other women, but
ultimately he finds that none of them compare to Holly.

Around Christmas in Season 7, Toby is forced to leave the office due to
being selected as part of the jury duty for a local murder case,
resulting in Holly returning as the temporary HR replacement. There is
initial tension between the two of them and hesitation on her side
(mostly after her sudden break-up with A.J.), but Holly finally reunites
with Michael after realizing the two are soulmates. The two continue
dating for a few weeks, and on Valentine's Day, they tell each other
they love each other, decide to move in together, and resolve that they
will not allow Dunder Mifflin to interfere with their future together.

With her time at the Scranton branch almost up and the recent knowledge
that her aging parents need to be taken care of, they ultimately become
engaged. Holly later moves back to Colorado and Michael follows her soon
after. In the finale it is revealed that they have children together. It
was revealed in a photo album on NBC that they have three children and
are expecting their fourth child.[^19]

### Other romantic relationships

Michael's longest relationship before his marriage was with [Jan
Levinson](Jan_Levinson "wikilink") ([Melora
Hardin](Melora_Hardin "wikilink")), his original-then-former boss from
Corporate. Starting with a one-night stand after they closed their
business deal at [Chili's](Chili's "wikilink") in "[The
Client](The_Client_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael and Jan begin
awkwardly dating, become an official couple, and eventually move in
together after Jan is fired from her job—although Jan usually treated
Michael with contempt. After Michael fails to defend Jan in her
[wrongful dismissal suit](wrongful_dismissal "wikilink") against Dunder
Mifflin, they remain together for a short while, but end up blowing up
at each other during an ill-fated dinner party and eventually break up.
He also dated Carol (played by Carell's wife [Nancy
Walls](Nancy_Carell "wikilink")), a real estate agent from whom Michael
bought his condominium. Michael was much more interested in Carol than
she was in him, and after he made an unwanted and rejected impromptu
public marriage proposal, Michael's decision to
[Photoshop](Photo_manipulation#"Photoshop"_as_a_verb "wikilink")
pictures of himself over Carol's ex-husband in her family pictures
resulted in their breakup.

On a business trip to [Winnipeg](Winnipeg "wikilink"), Michael and
"Concierge Marie" become close, and Michael does not wish to leave her
after they are caught necking in her suite. After Jim and Pam's wedding,
Michael begins dating Pam's mother Helene (much to Pam's horror), but he
breaks up with her on her birthday after discovering she is turning 58.
Near the end of season six, Michael begins dating Donna ([Amy
Pietz](Amy_Pietz "wikilink")), the manager of a local bar, but later
finds out that she's married and he is, as he puts it, "the mistress".
He continues seeing her until the disgust of his employees drives him to
listen to his conscience and break things off with her. In Season 7's
"[Sex Ed](Sex_Ed_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Michael reunites in person
or by telephone with all of his past girlfriends when he believes that
he has contracted [herpes](herpes "wikilink"). In doing so, he realizes
that Holly was the only one he truly loved.

## Legacy of "That's What She Said"

The show often uses the joke "[that's what she
said](that's_what_she_said "wikilink")", originally popularized by the
*[Wayne's World](Wayne's_World "wikilink")* sketch on *[Saturday Night
Live](Saturday_Night_Live "wikilink")*.[^20] In the original BBC version
of *The Office*, Ricky Gervais's character [David
Brent](David_Brent "wikilink") frequently uses the similar phrase "[as
the actress said to the
bishop](Said_the_actress_to_the_bishop "wikilink")" as an inappropriate
joke. Michael compulsively inserts the phrase as a sexually suggestive
[double entendre](double_entendre "wikilink"), finding it amusing in
even the most inappropriate circumstances.[^21][^22]

The phrase has become so associated with the character that the
television show *[30 Rock](30_Rock "wikilink")*, in the episode "[TGS
Hates Women](TGS_Hates_Women "wikilink")", there is a scene where [Liz
Lemon](Liz_Lemon "wikilink") ([Tina Fey](Tina_Fey "wikilink")) becomes
infuriated at another character's use of the phrase, exclaiming, "[Steve
Carell](Steve_Carell "wikilink") owns 'That's What She Said,' okay? He
owns it!" In the episode "[Goodbye,
Michael](Goodbye,_Michael "wikilink")", "That's what she said" is Steve
Carell's final line as a series regular; it is also his first line on
returning as a guest star in "[Finale](Finale_(The_Office) "wikilink")".

## Comparison with David Brent

Although originally based on [David Brent](David_Brent "wikilink"),
Scott developed into a significantly different character than his
British counterpart. Whereas Brent is shown to be irredeemably
incompetent, Scott is portrayed as an outstanding salesman who is
unwisely promoted to a management role to which he appears completely
ill-suited. (In a scathing performance review during episode eight of
season two, [Jan Levinson](Jan_Levinson "wikilink") suggests that Scott
should be removed from his management role and return to sales.) Scott
is thus an apt example of the [Peter
Principle](Peter_Principle "wikilink") which states that competent
persons in a hierarchical organization will "rise to the level of their
incompetence" after which they will not advance.

Despite his failings, Scott has been oddly successful as regional
manager. This is attributed, in part, to his weakness of procrastination
wherein he typically forfeits a bad choice by seeking the advice of his
more competent subordinates (such as Jim, Oscar, or Darryl) and uses
their recommendations. Scott's success is also partly attributed to his
main strength: genuinely caring about the well-being of the office and
treating his employees like family. When he took over the Scranton
Branch he decreased costs by 17%, without firing any personnel. After
the merger of the two branches Scott does not lose a single client
despite a great deal of employee turnover (much of which he was directly
responsible for). He received a \$3,000 bonus for firing Devon, most
likely because his doing so saved the company around \$50,000. Although
it is suggested that Brent has had similar success, such claims only
ever come from Brent himself, thus making them unreliable.

Scott's social immaturity and inability to cope with responsibility is
balanced with a personality that is much more caring than Brent's, even
if both make unwise comments in the heat of the moment. Unlike Brent,
who pretends to be friendly with many of his employees purely for the
benefit of the cameras, Scott seems to genuinely like his colleagues,
with the exception of Human Resources Director [Toby
Flenderson](Toby_Flenderson "wikilink"). Scott's need to be liked by his
staff and his belief that people see him as a genuine friend leads him
to become very hurt when he realizes this is not the case. Most, if not
all, of Scott's managerial blunders can be directly correlated with the
degree to which he desires to be liked by his employees or jealously
seeks their approval.

The [DVD commentary](DVD_commentary "wikilink") to the pilot episode
suggests that Scott's character continues a process begun in the second
UK series, in which Gervais and Merchant intentionally made Brent less
nasty, and more of a [buffoon](buffoon "wikilink"). It is said in the
commentary that Gervais and Merchant suggested that this be applied to
Scott. This also reflects a general change in the US version's attitude,
which is more sympathetic to the characters, and tones down the cruel
humor of the original. The commentary also says that Steve Carell had
not seen more than a few minutes of the original UK series when he was
offered the role of Scott, and has since made a conscious decision not
to watch it in case it influences his own performance. During an
interview on [Marc Maron](Marc_Maron "wikilink")'s podcast, [Jenna
Fischer](Jenna_Fischer "wikilink") said that, when initially developing
the show, Gervais explained that it is much more common in the UK for
people to spend many years working at jobs that they dislike or are
unfit for than it is in the US, which is why Michael Scott is portrayed
as being significantly more successful in the workplace than was Brent.

The show's writers have said that the 2005 hit movie *[The 40-Year-Old
Virgin](The_40-Year-Old_Virgin "wikilink")* provided very useful
guidance as they refined the character along with Steve Carell between
the first and second seasons. Michael Scott wore a large amount of hair
gel and dressed sloppily in Season 1, but by Season 2 he had a more
conventional haircut and dressed much more neatly. Also, while Michael
is often rude and nasty in Season 1, he is generally nicer and less
hard-edged in subsequent seasons.

In the seventh-season episode "[The Seminar](The_Seminar "wikilink")",
Michael in fact briefly meets David Brent in an office lobby and they
establish an immediate rapport, joking together and generally signalling
that they would have been good friends.

## Behind the scenes

- Series creator [Greg Daniels](Greg_Daniels "wikilink") envisioned
  Michael Scott behaving as if he "was hoping that the documentary about
  this would one day be seen by [Jennifer
  Aniston](Jennifer_Aniston "wikilink"), and I was just trying to
  impress her any way I possibly could."[^23] On the audio commentary
  for ["Valentine's Day"](Valentine's_Day_(The_Office) "wikilink"),
  Daniels notes that he included a meeting between Michael and two other
  branch managers to contrast Michael's level of competence with theirs.
  While Michael is not as dynamic as Josh Porter, who is later hired in
  a senior management position at [Staples](Staples_Inc. "wikilink"),
  his management skills are superior to those of the hopelessly inept
  Craig. Daniels comments that Michael could be an adequate but
  unexceptional branch manager who, despite his antics, is just
  competent enough to avoid being fired.[^24]
- Writer [B. J. Novak](B._J._Novak "wikilink") explains that Michael
  Scott drives a [Sebring](Chrysler_Sebring_(convertible) "wikilink")
  because it is the most ostentatious car he can afford, opting for a
  convertible despite the fact that the climate in Scranton is cool even
  in the summer.[^25]
- After the airing of "[Garage
  Sale](Garage_Sale_(The_Office) "wikilink")", Colorado governor [John
  Hickenlooper](John_Hickenlooper "wikilink") humorously issued a press
  release appointing Michael Scott as Director of Paper Distribution in
  their Department of Natural Resources.[^26]
