# Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc.

**Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc.** is a fictional
[paper](paper "wikilink") and [office
supplies](office_supplies "wikilink") wholesale company featured in the
American television series *[The
Office](The_Office_(American_TV_series) "wikilink")*. It is
[analogous](Analogy "wikilink") to Wernham Hogg in the [British
original](The_Office_(UK_TV_series) "wikilink") of the series, and
Papiers Jennings and Cogirep in the [French Canadian](La_Job "wikilink")
and [French](Le_Bureau "wikilink") adaptations, respectively.
Originally, the company was completely fictitious, but eventually, the
brand was used to sell products at [Staples](Staples_Inc. "wikilink")
and other office supply outlets.[^1]

Two websites were created to support the fictional company,[^2] one with
the image of a public website, and one meant to look like the
corporation's [intranet](intranet "wikilink").[^3] NBC sold branded
merchandise at its NBC Universal Store website.[^4] Its logo was
prominently displayed in several locations in downtown [Scranton,
Pennsylvania](Scranton,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"), where the show is set.
Scranton has been associated internationally with Dunder Mifflin due to
the show's international reach. In a 2008 [St. Patrick's
Day](St._Patrick's_Day "wikilink") speech in the suburb of [Dickson
City](Dickson_City,_Pennsylvania "wikilink"),
then-[Taoiseach](Taoiseach "wikilink") (prime minister) of Ireland,
[Bertie Ahern](Bertie_Ahern "wikilink"), referred to the city's
fictional branch office.[^5]

The name is also at the center of a [trademark
infringement](trademark_infringement "wikilink") lawsuit filed by
[NBCUniversal](NBCUniversal "wikilink") against Jay Kennette Media
Group; when NBC tried to obtain a trademark for the name in 2020, they
were denied because Jay Kennette had already registered the trademark in
2017,[^6] and was selling merchandise well before NBC.[^7][^8]

## Overview

A fourth-season episode, "[Dunder Mifflin
Infinity](Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity "wikilink")", said the company was
founded in 1949 by Robert Dunder ([John Ingle](John_Ingle "wikilink"))
and Robert Mifflin, initially to sell
[brackets](Bracket_(architecture) "wikilink") for use in construction.
The fifth-season episode "[Company Picnic](Company_Picnic "wikilink")"
said that the co-founders met on a tour of [Dartmouth
College](Dartmouth_College "wikilink"). *[U.S. News & World
Report](U.S._News_&_World_Report "wikilink")* likens it to many actual
companies in its size range: "It is facing an increasingly competitive
marketplace. Like many smaller players, it just can't compete with the
low prices charged by [big-box](Big-box_store "wikilink") rivals like
[Staples](Staples_Inc. "wikilink"), [OfficeMax](OfficeMax "wikilink")
and [Office Depot](Office_Depot "wikilink"), and it seems to be
constantly bleeding corporate customers that are focused on cutting
costs themselves."[^9] The show's creators share this assessment—"It's
basically a Staples, just not as big", says co-producer Kent
Zbornak[^10]—as do some of those companies. "Since Dunder Mifflin could
be considered among our competitors", says Chuck Rubin, an Office Depot
executive, "I think [Michael
Scott](Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "wikilink") is actually the perfect
person to run their [Scranton](Scranton,_Pennsylvania "wikilink")
office."[^11] ![Dunder Mifflin logo displayed in Scranton's [Mall at
Steamtown](Mall_at_Steamtown "wikilink"), frequently mentioned on the
show\|alt=Three adults and a child in a stroller in front of a set of

Above them is a sign with "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" on it in white letters on a black background")
The company was depicted as based in New York City, with branches in
smaller [Northeastern](Northeastern_United_States "wikilink") cities.
Episodes are set in the Scranton branch, but other branches have been
mentioned and seen. The now-closed [Stamford,
Connecticut](Stamford,_Connecticut "wikilink") branch was seen when [Jim
Halpert](Jim_Halpert "wikilink") ([John
Krasinski](John_Krasinski "wikilink")) transferred there during the
first half of the third season.[^12] Another episode, "[Branch
Wars](Branch_Wars "wikilink")", gave viewers a brief glimpse of the
[Utica](Utica,_New_York "wikilink") branch, one of several purportedly
in [upstate New York](upstate_New_York "wikilink"). Zbornak says that
the city was on the shortlist for where to base the show, with some of
its writers having ties to [Central New
York](Central_New_York "wikilink"), and that they always intended for at
least a branch office to be located there, for reasons of
[phonetics](phonetics "wikilink"). "Utica was just such a
different-sounding name than Scranton", Zbornak says. But also, "we had
done a little research and thought our kind of business could survive in
Utica."[^13]

A [Buffalo](Buffalo,_New_York "wikilink") branch has been mentioned in
several episodes,[^14] and a [Rochester](Rochester,_New_York "wikilink")
office was also mentioned in the episode titled "[Lecture
Circuit](Lecture_Circuit "wikilink")". The Dunder Mifflin website also
lists a [Yonkers](Yonkers,_New_York "wikilink") branch.
[Albany](Albany,_New_York "wikilink") is yet another mentioned New York
location, which in a deleted scene in "[Stress
Relief](Stress_Relief_(The_Office) "wikilink")" is revealed to have
closed. It is also said that there are branches in other states,
including: [Akron, Ohio](Akron,_Ohio "wikilink"); [Camden, New
Jersey](Camden,_New_Jersey "wikilink"); and [Nashua, New
Hampshire](Nashua,_New_Hampshire "wikilink").[^15] In "[Company
Picnic](Company_Picnic "wikilink")", it is announced that the Camden and
Yonkers branches have closed and that the Buffalo branch is about to
close. In "[Boys and
Girls](Boys_and_Girls_(The_Office_episode) "wikilink")", a [Pittsfield,
Massachusetts](Pittsfield,_Massachusetts "wikilink") branch was
mentioned by [Jan](Jan_Levinson "wikilink") as having been shut down
when their warehouse workers unionized. The episode "[Turf
War](Turf_War_(The_Office) "wikilink")" focuses on the closing of the
[Binghamton](Binghamton,_New_York "wikilink") branch and how reps from
the [Syracuse](Syracuse,_New_York "wikilink") branch are competing with
Scranton employees for Binghamton's old clients.

Business writer Megan Barnett has pointed out parallels between Dunder
Mifflin and the real-life [W.B. Mason](W.B._Mason "wikilink") paper
company based near [Boston](Boston "wikilink"), in [Brockton,
Massachusetts](Brockton,_Massachusetts "wikilink"). It is similarly
regional in focus, serving corporate and institutional customers in [New
England](New_England "wikilink") and the
[Mid-Atlantic](Mid-Atlantic_states "wikilink") states. Like Dunder
Mifflin, its original product line ([rubber
stamps](rubber_stamp "wikilink")) was something other than paper, and it
faced stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too,
has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009,
it had an accounting scandal that resulted in a \$545,000 payment to
corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin had to deal with the arrest
of [Ryan Howard](Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "wikilink") for fraud the year
before.[^16]

### Depiction of corporate culture

The company's "clearly dysfunctional" top-down management style is a
major source of tension on the show, notes Chicago-based writer Ramsin
Canon. Corporate headquarters rejects the [television
commercial](television_commercial "wikilink") Michael created, as he, in
turn, insisted on his ideas for the commercial.[^17][^18] [Ryan
Howard](Ryan_Howard_(The_Office) "wikilink") ([B. J.
Novak](B._J._Novak "wikilink")), who began as a
[temp](temporary_work "wikilink"), becomes Michael's new boss because he
has an [M.B.A.](Master_of_Business_Administration "wikilink") despite
never having sold any paper or paper products.[^19] The show's depiction
of a dysfunctional corporate culture has led some commentators to liken
Dunder Mifflin to the software maker Initech in [Mike
Judge](Mike_Judge "wikilink")'s cult comedy *[Office
Space](Office_Space "wikilink")*[^20] and the nameless company in which
the *[Dilbert](Dilbert "wikilink")* [comic
strip](comic_strip "wikilink") is set.[^21] ![The Pennsylvania Paper &
Supply Company tower, seen in *The Office*'s opening credits.\|alt=A
brick tower with peaked roof on the right-hand side of a street in front
of the camera. There are green hills in the
background.](The_Office_-_Penn_Paper_-_Landscape_(48472737706).jpg "The Pennsylvania Paper & Supply Company tower, seen in The Office's opening credits.|alt=A brick tower with peaked roof on the right-hand side of a street in front of the camera. There are green hills in the background.")
Dunder Mifflin is also depicted as needing help to accommodate the
demands of a [diverse workforce](Diversity_(business) "wikilink").
Episodes have focused on sensitivity training sessions and other
informal efforts.[^22] [Sexual harassment](Sexual_harassment "wikilink")
has occurred often enough, however, that it has lent its name to [an
episode](Sexual_Harassment_(The_Office) "wikilink"). [Employment
lawyer](Employment_law "wikilink") Julie Elgar started a
[blog](blog "wikilink") analyzing each episode for plot developments
likely to be [actionable](litigation "wikilink") if they occurred in
real life and estimating the legal bill and possible
[verdict](verdict "wikilink") the company would incur should a suit be
filed—as Michael's former supervisor, [Jan
Levinson](Jan_Levinson "wikilink") ([Melora
Hardin](Melora_Hardin "wikilink")) did in one episode, alleging
[wrongful termination](wrongful_termination "wikilink").[^23] [Greg
Daniels](Greg_Daniels "wikilink"), the show's creator, said many episode
plotlines are based on anecdotes recounted during the [sensitivity
training](diversity_training "wikilink") he and the other members of the
show's cast and crew are required to take annually as employees of NBC,
a [Comcast](Comcast "wikilink")
[subsidiary](subsidiary "wikilink").[^24] The episode "[Boys and
Girls](Boys_and_Girls_(The_Office) "wikilink")" showed that the company
strongly resisted [unionization](trade_union "wikilink") efforts by its
employees, to the point of [closing down a
branch](union_busting "wikilink"), as many real companies do or threaten
to do in the same situation.[^25]

## Locations and sets used

The office and warehouse of the Scranton branch office were sets on [the
production company's](Reveille_Productions "wikilink") office in [Van
Nuys, California](Van_Nuys,_California "wikilink"), although a real
office was used in the show's first season. For episodes in season two
and beyond, scenes set in the parking lot used the exterior of the
production company's office building. Since the stage set had no
windows, writer [Jennifer Celotta](Jennifer_Celotta "wikilink")'s office
was dressed to look like [Michael
Scott](Michael_Scott_(The_Office) "wikilink")'s when the script called
for him or someone else to look out the window into the parking
lot.[^26] In the second and subsequent seasons, the office interiors and
exteriors are at a different location in Van Nuys.[^27] ![Annual reports
and paper on seats of "uncommon stockholders" at 2007 *The Office*
convention.\|alt=A book titled "Dunder Mifflin 2007 Annual Report" on
top of a ream of paper in two empty plastic
chairs](Dunder_Mifflin_uncommon_stockholders'_meeting_chairs.jpg "Annual reports and paper on seats of "uncommon stockholders" at 2007 The Office convention.|alt=A book titled "Dunder Mifflin 2007 Annual Report" on top of a ream of paper in two empty plastic chairs")
Some viewers have presumed that the [Pennsylvania Paper & Supply
Company](Pennsylvania_Paper_and_Supply_Company "wikilink")'s tower, a
downtown Scranton landmark that appears in video footage shot by cast
member [John Krasinski](John_Krasinski "wikilink") for the show's
[opening credits](opening_credits "wikilink"),[^28] is the Dunder
Mifflin office.[^29] The real company, which also sells paper and office
supplies, has welcomed the exposure (and increase in business) and has a
ground-floor [showroom](showroom "wikilink") where it sells both its
products and [T-shirts](T-shirt "wikilink") with the tower. In 2008 it
announced it would add a Dunder Mifflin logo to the circular insets near
the top of the tower.[^30] As of December 2021, this logo can be seen
through Google's Street View at the corner of Vine Street and Penn
Avenue. Mifflin Avenue ends adjacent to the Penn Paper & Supply
building.

## Presence in real world

The show's success has led to selling actual products with the Dunder
Mifflin logo as [souvenirs](souvenir "wikilink"). NBC sells branded
T-shirts, mugs, calendars, and other items at its website,[^31] as well
as in the [NBC](NBC "wikilink") store located in [New York
City](New_York_City "wikilink"). In 2006, the website 80stees.com ranked
Dunder Mifflin second only to [Duff Beer](Duff_Beer "wikilink") from
*[The Simpsons](The_Simpsons "wikilink")* as the best fictional
brand.[^32]

At the first annual *The Office* convention in Scranton in 2007, fans
who had paid for reserved seating at an "uncommon stockholders
meeting"[^33] in the [Mall at Steamtown](Mall_at_Steamtown "wikilink")
received an [annual report](annual_report "wikilink") and complimentary
[ream](Units_of_paper_quantity#Ream "wikilink") of paper. A nearby
elevator shaft is also decorated with the company logo. While the
Scranton branch's address, 1725 Slough Avenue, does not exist (the
street name was invented as a tribute to the [original British version
of the show](The_Office_(UK_TV_series) "wikilink"), set in
[Slough](Slough "wikilink"), near London), the company logo can be seen
two places in the city's downtown section outside the mall: on one of
the pedestrian overpasses along Lackawanna Avenue, and a lamppost banner
in front of [City Hall](Scranton_City_Hall "wikilink").

In November 2011, [Staples Inc.](Staples_Inc. "wikilink") announced that
they would be selling their product of manufactured paper under the
"Dunder Mifflin" name, under license from NBC's parent company,
[Comcast](Comcast "wikilink").[^34] The Dunder Mifflin products were
produced and sold by [Quill.com](Quill_Corporation "wikilink"), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Staples. The brand expanded its paper product line
beyond manufactured paper in November 2012.[^35]

In August 2022, the production held a convention at the
[Meadowlands](New_Jersey_Meadowlands "wikilink") in [New
Jersey](New_Jersey "wikilink"). Dubbed "Dundercon", the event allowed
fans to meet up with cast members from the show. [^36]

## Other appearances

- In the NBC series *[Las Vegas](Las_Vegas_(TV_series) "wikilink")*
  episode "The Story of Owe", Dunder Mifflin is mentioned to have booked
  a convention.
- In *[Randal's Monday](Randal's_Monday "wikilink")*, a Dunder Mifflin
  Warehouse 42 sign is visible in a city scene.[^37]
